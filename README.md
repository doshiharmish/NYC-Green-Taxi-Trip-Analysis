<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HxxpKTMb4ronSSNuCQ6ozPtX48lTV21V#scrollTo=f8RAkE7-g0uR>
## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the NYC Green Taxi Trip Data from January 2022 to January 2023. Historically, green Taxis in NYC, authorized for street-hail pickups outside the central business district and airports, were introduced to extend taxi services to underserved areas beyond Manhattan. Yellow Taxis, traditionally dominant in Manhattan and airport street-hail services, originally held exclusive rights in high-demand areas, but now share territories with Green Taxis, expanding the latter's reach. The primary focus in this project lies in utilizing machine learning techniques for regression and classification to achieve two key goals:

1. ***Fare Amount Prediction***: Utilizing features such as pickup and drop-off locations, trip distance, DateTime, and pertinent attributes, the project aims to construct a regression model. This model will predict the fare amount for individual taxi trips, enhancing accuracy in fare estimation.
2. ***Profitable Pickup Location Identification***: Leveraging pickup locations, trip distances, and fare amounts, the project intends to develop a clustering model specifically tailored to identify profitable pickup locations for green taxis. This analysis aims to assist drivers in optimizing their pickup strategies for increased profitability.

## Feature Engineering
### 1. Taxi Zone Integration
Incorporating Taxi Zone data into our main trip dataset to augment information related to Pickup and Drop Boroughs and Zones.

### 2. Column Selection and Removal
- We are dropping columns deemed unnecessary for our analysis:
  - ***ehail_fee***: Contains zero records.
  - ***passenger_count***: Prone to inaccuracies as it relies on driver input.
  - ***store_and_fwd_flag, trip_type, payment_type***: Irrelevant for price prediction.
- We are also dropping columns where there is not a single entry.
  
### 3. Column Renaming
To ensure uniformity, we rename columns like 'lpep_pickup_datetime' and 'lpep_dropoff_datetime' to a standardized format.

### 4. Trip Filtering
We filter trips based on various criteria:

- ***Fare Amount***: Removing trips below the base fare of $3.
- ***Trip Distance***: Filtering out trips with negative or excessive (over 100 miles) distances.
- ***Time Constraints***: Filtering out trips with negative or excessive (over 180 minutes) time.

### 5. Handling Missing Values
Trips with any missing data across columns are dropped.

### 6. DateTime Feature Extraction
We extract additional DateTime features into new columns:

- Features like 'dayofweek', 'pickuphour', 'drophour', 'pickupdate', 'dropoffdate' are created.
- A new column identifies trips conducted during peak hours (7 am to 10 am and 5 pm to 7 pm).
- Marking trips conducted on holidays for further analysis.

### 7. Congestion Surcharge Flagging
Incorporating a flag to denote the presence of a congestion surcharge in the trip data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. Vendor
In New York, taxi services are offered by two vendors: Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC (Vendor 1) and VeriFone Inc. (Vendor 2). The data distribution indicates a substantial disparity in trip counts between the vendors, with Vendor 2 accounting for 87% of total trips. In comparison, Vendor 1 has a notably lower contribution with 13% of total trips.

In terms of dropoff locations, East Harlem North and South, Central Harlem, and Upper East Side North are prominent, signifying frequent trip completions in these areas. These neighborhoods feature a mix of residential, commercial, and cultural elements, drawing diverse trip demands likely influenced by residential density, cultural landmarks, and commercial activity. East and West of Central Park, the Upper East and Upper West Sides boast affluent residential areas, while Morningside Heights showcases a university-centric landscape. Overall, the concentrated demand in specific neighborhoods underlines their unique characteristics, driving taxi usage trends in these distinct locales.

### 9. Distance VS Fare Amount

The fare amount typically corresponds to the distance covered during a trip, following a general pattern of increase. However, upon closer inspection, anomalies emerge within the dataset, notably instances where the fare amount significantly exceeds the expected cost for a specific distance. There were numerous trips where the fare amount spiked to as high as $500, despite the distance being relatively short, approximately 5-6 miles. These anomalies suggest potential irregularities or factors beyond distance influencing fare calculations, warranting further investigation into the specific conditions or variables contributing to these unusually high fares for comparatively short distances.

## Splitting Data & Dimension Reduction

In the data preparation for regression, we designated the 'fare_amount' as the target variable 'y', and the remaining columns as features 'X'. Categorical variables such as 'VendorID', 'peak_hours', 'holiday_flag', 'pickup_dayofweek', and 'pickup_hour' were one-hot encoded to enhance machine learning model training. Subsequently, the dataset underwent a 60-40 split into training and testing sets for evaluation purposes. Additionally, we conducted dimensionality reduction on the independent variables, with the first three components capturing a significant portion of the overall variance in the dataset.

## Modeling

Among the regression models implemented to predict fare amounts, KNN Regression performed the best with the lowest Mean Squared Error (9.71) and the highest R-squared (0.9248), indicating superior predictive accuracy. Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor also showed competitive performance, with good R-squared values. Lasso Regression and Linear Regression, while delivering acceptable results, exhibited slightly higher Mean Squared Error and lower R-squared, suggesting a comparatively lower predictive accuracy. In summary, KNN Regression stands out as the top-performing model in this context, emphasizing its effectiveness in predicting fare amounts accurately.
